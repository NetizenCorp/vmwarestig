VMWare STIG Checker for ESXi and vCenter Appliance.

This a beta (proof of concept) to integrate python and powerCLI to perform STIG checks by only supplying the IP, Username, and Password.  
In order to run properly, VMWare powerCLI must be installed.  The application uses winPython64 3.6.5, which does not need to be installed.  

Instruction:

Unzip Vmware_STIG_Checker_App and run the bat file.  If a Microsoft message pops up, choose to run anyway.
The output will be a text file in the same directory as bat file that was ran.
