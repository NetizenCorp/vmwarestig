VMWare STIG Checker for ESXi and vCenter Appliance.

This is a beta (proof of concept) to integrate the python and powerCLI to perform DISA STIG checks by only supplying the IP, Username, and Password of a VMWare instance.

In order to run properly the VMWare powerCLI must be installed.  The application uses winPython64 3.6.5, which does not need to be installed.  

Instructions:

Unzip Vmware_STIG_Checker_App and run the bat file.  If a Microsoft message pops up, choose to run anyway.
The output will be a text file in the same directory as bat file that was run.
